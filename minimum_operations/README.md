# Minimum Operations

## Problem Description

The goal of this project is to calculate the fewest number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters in a text file starting with a single "H" character. The only two operations allowed are:

- **Copy All**: Copies all characters in the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes one character to the file.

### Objective:
Given a number `n`, calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` "H" characters in the file. If `n` is impossible to achieve, return 0.

### Example:

For `n = 9`, the sequence of operations would be:
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHH

The number of operations required is 6.

## Solution Approach

To determine the fewest number of operations, the problem can be broken down by prime factorization. Each prime factor of `n` contributes to the minimum number of operations required. The solution involves repeatedly dividing `n` by its smallest factors and counting the operations.

### Steps:
1. Start with `n = 1`.
2. Copy All (1 â†’ 1) and then use Paste to multiply it by its prime factors.
3. For each factor, the number of operations is equivalent to the factor's value.
4. If `n` is a prime number, it contributes one operation.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(sqrt(n))**, as we only need to check factors up to the square root of `n`.

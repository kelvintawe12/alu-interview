# Pascal's Triangle

## Introduction
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Structure
The structure of Pascal's Triangle is as follows:
```
    1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
 1 5 10 10 5 1
```

## Properties
- The first and last elements of each row are 1.
- Each interior element is the sum of the two elements directly above it.
- The nth row corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^(n-1).

## Applications
Pascal's Triangle has applications in:
- Algebra: Binomial expansions
- Probability: Combinations and permutations
- Computer Science: Algorithms and data structures

## Implementation
Here is a simple implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python:

```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
      row = [1] * (i + 1)
      for j in range(1, i):
        row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
      triangle.append(row)
    return triangle

# Example usage
n = 5
triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
for row in triangle:
    print(row)
```

## Conclusion
Pascal's Triangle is a fundamental mathematical concept with numerous applications in various fields. Understanding its structure and properties can provide valuable insights into algebra, probability, and computer science.

## Additional Information
Pascal's Triangle also exhibits several interesting patterns and properties:
- **Symmetry**: The triangle is symmetric.
- **Hockey Stick Pattern**: The sum of the elements in a diagonal line starting from the edge of the triangle equals the element directly below the end of the line.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: The sums of the shallow diagonals of Pascal's Triangle are the Fibonacci numbers.
- **Sierpinski Triangle**: Coloring the odd and even numbers differently in Pascal's Triangle reveals a fractal pattern known as the Sierpinski Triangle.

## Visual Representation
A visual representation of Pascal's Triangle can help in understanding its structure and properties. Here is an example of how it can be visualized:

```
        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 6 15 20 15 6 1
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
```

Exploring these patterns can provide deeper insights into the mathematical beauty of Pascal's Triangle.
